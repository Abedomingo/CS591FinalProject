# CS591FinalProject
The final project for CS591.

# Notes for Aberaham
* Data has been normalized
* managed to collect the 100 bots from #Covid. The first couple groups were just sparse by chance
* We should look at the average bot score of all users sampled. Some hashtags had many people with scores higher than 3 but less than our threshhold
